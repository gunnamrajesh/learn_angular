                            Apple Recipes- Apples could very well be one of the most widely consumed fruits across the world. You and I might take this humble fruit for granted, but believe it or not it works magic when cooked and added into preparations and has a range of health benefiting properties. When I was young, my mom would always keep an apple in my lunch box. Indeed, it is a great way to beat the mid-day hunger pangs and snack on the goodness of apples instead.
                            I always like to use raw apples in my salads. I even like finely shredding them and mixing it in curd along with some honey, nuts and a few other fruits. Other favourite ways to add apples in my diet is to juice them or simply add a few pieces in my shakes and smoothies. Taking it up a notch, a sea of delicacies can be created with this fruit. What excite my palate are those heavenly crumbles, pies and tarts baked using delicate apple pieces. Apple juice and cider vinegar are also popularly used in many cuisines and preparations across the globe. While apple juice is a nice way to balance a dish, incorporating a dash of sweetness, cider vinegar can just bring alive and enhance the varied flavours in salads and soups.
                            It doesn't really matter if one likes apples or peaches. Cooking is an art which makes delicacies favourite with people thereby making the associated ingredients favourable.
